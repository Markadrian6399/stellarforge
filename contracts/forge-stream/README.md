# Forge Stream

## Storage Strategy

`forge-stream` uses two Soroban storage tiers. The rule of thumb: use
**persistent** for data that must survive beyond a single transaction or
contract instance TTL; use **instance** for small, frequently-accessed
scalars that are always read together with the contract instance.

| `DataKey` variant | Storage type | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Stream(u64)` | `persistent` | Stream data must outlive the instance TTL while tokens remain unclaimed |
| `NextId` | `instance` | Small scalar always read on `create_stream`; co-located with instance for efficiency |
| `ActiveStreamsCount` | `instance` | Updated on every create/cancel/finish; always accessed with other instance data |
| `SenderStreams(Address)` | `persistent` | Grows with each stream; must survive beyond instance TTL for historical lookups |
| `RecipientStreams(Address)` | `persistent` | Same rationale as `SenderStreams` |

When adding a new `DataKey` variant, choose the storage type using this
checklist:
- Does the data need to survive after the contract instance TTL expires? → **persistent**
- Is it a small scalar read on almost every call? → **instance**
- Is it keyed per-user or per-stream (unbounded growth)? → **persistent**

## Resource Usage

> **Note:** Resource usage estimates are approximate and may vary based on contract state and input sizes. Run `stellar contract invoke` with `--cost` flag to measure actual usage for your specific use case.

### Function Resource Estimates

| Function | CPU Instructions | Memory (bytes) | Ledger Reads | Ledger Writes | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `create_stream` | ~85,000 | ~3,500 | 2 | 3 | Most expensive - validates inputs, creates stream |
| `withdraw` | ~65,000 | ~2,500 | 3 | 2 | Calculates accrued amount, transfers tokens |
| `cancel_stream` | ~70,000 | ~3,000 | 3 | 2 | Calculates final amounts, refunds/pays out |
| `pause_stream` | ~45,000 | ~2,000 | 2 | 1 | Marks stream as paused |
| `resume_stream` | ~50,000 | ~2,200 | 2 | 1 | Adjusts for paused time, resumes stream |
| `get_stream` | ~20,000 | ~1,500 | 2 | 0 | Read-only query |
| `get_withdrawable` | ~25,000 | ~1,800 | 2 | 0 | Calculates current accrued amount |

### Most Expensive Functions

1. **`create_stream`** (~85,000 CPU instructions)
   - Why: Validates sender/recipient, encodes stream parameters, creates multiple storage entries
   - Optimization tip: Reuse stream configurations for recurring payments

2. **`cancel_stream`** (~70,000 CPU instructions)
   - Why: Calculates final amounts, handles partial refunds, updates multiple storage entries
   - Optimization tip: Use pause/resume instead of cancel/recreate for temporary stops

### Cost Estimation

Soroban charges fees based on:
- **CPU Instructions:** ~0.0001 XLM per 10,000 instructions
- **Memory:** ~0.00001 XLM per byte
- **Ledger Entries:** ~0.001 XLM per read/write

**Example:** Creating a stream costs approximately:
- CPU: 85,000 instructions × 0.0001 XLM / 10,000 = 0.00085 XLM
- Memory: 3,500 bytes × 0.00001 XLM = 0.035 XLM
- Ledger: 5 operations × 0.001 XLM = 0.005 XLM
- **Total:** ~0.041 XLM per stream creation
